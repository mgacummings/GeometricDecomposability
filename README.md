# GeometricDecomposability
A Macaulay2 package to check whether an ideal is geometrically vertex decomposable.

## Installation

This package can be installed to Macaulay2 by copying the file `GeoetricDecomposability.m2` to your working directory from which you launch Macaulay2. 
Then in M2, run the command `installPackage "GeometricDecomposability"` and use the package as you would any other. 

In the future, this package will be included with Macaualy2 so external installation will not be necessary.


## Background

Geometrically vertex decomposable ideals can be viewed as a generalization of the properties of the Stanley-Reisner ideal of a vertex decomposable simplicial complex.
This family of ideals is based upon the geometric vertex decomposition property defined by Knutson, Miller, and Yong [KMY]. 
Klein and Rajchgot then gave a recursive definition for geometrically vertex decomposable ideals in [KR] using this notion.

An unmixed ideal $I$ in a polynomial ring $R$ is geometrically vertex decomposable if it is the zero ideal, the unit ideal, an ideal generated by indeterminates, or if there is a indeterminate $y$ of $R$ such that two ideals $C_{y,I}$ and $N_{y,I}$ constructed from $I$ are both geometrically vertex decomposable.

Observe that a geometrically vertex decomposable ideal is recursively defined. 
The complexity of verifying that an ideal is geometrically vertex decomposable will increase as the number of indeterminates appearing in the ideal increases.
