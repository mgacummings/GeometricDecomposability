## Mike's current to do

1. (First draft done) Write a function that performs a substitution of variables (as in gvd up to 
substitution)
1.5 Write code that takes in an ideal and an indeterminate and 
determines whether a geometric vertex decomp. after (nontrivial?) sub. 
works
2. Add test cases for (1)
3. Using (1), write a ``isGVDuptoSub'' function
4. Add test cases for (3)
3. Documentation for (1)
4. Documentation for (3)
